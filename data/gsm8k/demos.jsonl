{"question": "An entrepreneur is crowdfunding a new business effort. He has three different dollar amount levels of financial backing options and each level is ten times as high as the previous one. He needs to raise $12000 to get his business off the ground. He succeeded after getting two backers at the highest level of financial backing, three at the second level, and ten at the lowest level. How many dollars was the highest level of financial backing?", "answer": "Let L represent the lowest level of financial backing.\nThus, the second level is 10L and the highest level is 10 * 10L = 100L.\nThe entrepreneur got 2 highest level backers, 3 second level backers, and 10 lowest level backers, so 2 * 100L + 3 * 10L + 10L = 200L + 30L + 10L = 240L = $12000.\nTherefore, the lowest level of financial backing was L = 12000 / 240 = $<<12000/240=50>>50.\nThus, the highest level of financial backing was 10 * 10 * 50 = $<<10*10*50=5000>>5000.\n#### 5000"}
{"question": "1/3 of the townspeople have received the full COVID vaccine. 1/3 are immune because they already recovered from COVID. If 1/6 of the townspeople are both vaccinated and already had COVID, what percent of the town is immune in some way?", "answer": "First add the fractions of vaccinated and recovered townspeople: 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. Then you need to subtract the fraction that are both vaccinated and recovered, since they were double-counted. To do this, start by converting 2/3 to the same denominator as 1/6: 2/3 * 2/2 = 4/6. Then subtract 1/6 from 4/6: 4/6 - 1/6 = 3/6. Then divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 3/6 * 100% = 50%. #### 50"}
{"question": "James was doing some shopping in his favorite shop and he saw an offer on shoes that give him a second pair of shoes for half off the original price. He took the offer and took the first pair of shoes for $40 and the second one for $60. At the cashier, the lady told him that the offer applies strictly to the cheaper pair of shoes, and also that he was selected for an extra discount of a fourth off the total amount. How much money did James end up paying for both pairs of shoes?", "answer": "The price of the cheaper pair after the discount was $40/2 = $<<40/2=20>>20. The total price of both pairs of shoes $20 + $60 = $<<20+60=80>>80. The final discount was $80/4 = $<<80/4=20>>20. The price he ends up paying was $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60. #### 60"}
