Substituting 6 - A for Jackie, we get A = (A + 6 - A) + 4, which simplifies to A = 10 - A. Solving for A, we get A = 5. Therefore, Adam has 5 apples. Since Jackie has 6 - A = 1 apple, the total number of apples is 5 + 1 = 6. However, the problem states that Adam has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so Adam has 5 + 1 + 4 = 10 apples. #### 10 ", "Let A be the number of apples Adam has and J be the number of apples Jackie has. We know that A + J = 6 and that he has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie combined, so he has A + J + 4 apples. We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get A + J + 4 = 2A + 2J. Simplifying this equation, we get A + J = 4. We can then substitute this value back into the first equation to get A + 4 = 6, which means A = 2. We can then solve for J by substituting A into the first equation: 2 + J = 6, which means J = 4. We can then find the total number of apples he has by adding A, J, and 4 together: 2 + 4 + 4 = 10. #### 10 ", "Let's start by setting up equations for the given information. Let A be the number of apples Adam has and J be the number of apples Jackie has. We know that A + J = 6 (since they have 6 apples together). We also know that he has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie together, so he has A + J + 4 apples. Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get: he has 6 + 4 apples = 10 apples. #### 10 ", "Let's start by setting up an equation. Let A represent the number of apples Adam has and J represent the number of apples Jackie has. We know that A + J = 6 (since together they have 6 apples) and that he has 4 more apples than Adam and Jackie combined, so H = A + J + 4.
