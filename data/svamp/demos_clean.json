{"question": "Paul sold some books in a garage sale leaving him with 27 books. If he had 136 books initially. How many books did he sell?", "answer": "To find out how many books Paul sold, we need to subtract the number of books he has now from the number he had initially: 136 - 27 = <<136-27=109>>109 books.\nTherefore, Paul sold 109 books in the garage sale.\n#### 109"}

{"question": "There are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 345 groups and oranges are organized into 16 groups. How big is each group of oranges?", "answer": "To find out how big each group of oranges is, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of orange groups.\nSo, 384 oranges divided by 16 groups = <<384/16=24>>24 oranges per group.\n#### 24"}
{"question": "In a school there are 868 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 281 more girls than boys. How many pupils are there in that school?", "answer": "Let's use algebra to solve the problem.\nLet's call the number of boys \"b\".\nWe know that there are 868 girls and 281 more girls than boys, so:\n\n868 = b + 281\n\nWe can solve for \"b\" by subtracting 281 from both sides:\n\n587 = b\n\nSo there are 587 boys in the school.\nTo find the total number of pupils, we can add the number of girls and boys:\n\nTotal = 868 + 587 = <<868+587=1455>>1455\n\n#### 1455"}
{"question": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar. She already put in 3 cups of flour and 62 cups of sugar.. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?", "answer": "The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and she already put in 3 cups, so she still needs to add 9 - 3 = <<9-3=6>>6 cups of flour.\nThere is no indication that Mary needs to add more sugar, so the 62 cups of sugar are irrelevant to this question.\nTherefore, she needs to add 6 cups of flour.\n#### 6"}

How many more bottle caps than wrappers did danny find at the park?", "answer": "Danny found 50 bottle caps and 46 wrappers at the park.\nNow he has 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection.\nTo find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers he found at the park, we need to subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps: 50 - 46 = <<50-46=4>>4.\nTherefore, Danny found 4 more bottle caps than wrappers at the park.\n#### 4"}
